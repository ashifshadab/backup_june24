Machine Learning Fundamentals | Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1
From the series: Introduction to Machine Learning

Explore the fundamentals behind machine learning. Learn about two common Machine learning approaches:

Unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns in input data
Supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs
You’ll also learn about three common techniques within these approaches:

Clustering techniques put data into different groups based on shared characteristics in the data.
Classification techniques predict discrete responses—like whether an email is genuine or spam.
Regression techniques predict continuous responses, such as what temperature a thermostat should be set at or fluctuations in electricity demand.
